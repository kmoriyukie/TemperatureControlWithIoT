# This "bridge" script subscribes to messages inside the 6LoWPAN network using unencrypted MQTT
# and then publishes the messages to an external MQTT broker

# You can easily change this script, in case you need to subscribe to external topics 
# and publish them locally in the 6LoWPAN network.

# Libraries:
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import ssl
import sys


############ Please change these parameters for your own setup #########


# There is a Mosquitto server running locally on the Virtual Machine. 
# For the project, you should change this to the IPv6 server of the local MQTT broker:
LOCAL_MQTT_URL = "localhost"
# You may also try "test.mosquitto.org"

# A topic to get information from the zolertia board(s):	 
<<<<<<< HEAD
SENSORS_TOPIC = "mote/send"

SENSORS_TOPIC = "deec/send"

# Address of the External MQTT Broker:

local_client.on_message = on_local_message

print("Connecting locally to " + LOCAL_MQTT_URL + "...")
local_client.connect(LOCAL_MQTT_URL, 1883, 60)

# If we had just 1 connection we coud use client.loop_forever()
# since we have two, we'll use a while loop this way:

try:
   while True:
        local_client.loop(0.01) # timeout of 0.01 secs (max 100Hz)
        ext_client.loop(0.01)

except (KeyboardInterrupt): #catch keyboard interrupts
        sys.exit()


# You can test by running on your VM:
# mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t deec/send -m "Publiquei esta msg localmente e a bridge fez forward para fora!"

# Also test publishing something externally and check if you receive it locally with:
# mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t deec/receive
